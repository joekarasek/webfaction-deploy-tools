# Webfaction Deployment
#### By _**Joseph Karasek**_ for _**Hello World Devs**_

## Description

_This deployment script is meant to be used with [WebFaction](https://www.webfaction.com/) and was built as a development tool for the Tyson Steele projects. This script handles two tasks: 1) setting up the initial configuration on Webfaction for a static site (including the webapp, domain, and website) and 2) pulling the latest version of a site if the website already exists._

_This is the first python application I have ever written. Please feel free to give me feedback._

## Prerequisites

_You will need the following things properly installed on your computer._

* Python 2.7

## Installation

* It is highly suggested (but not required) that you place the script in the root directory of the project you are working on.
* Open the `example.siteConfig.py` file. Follow the instruction to create a `siteConfig.py` file

* It's suggested you add the following entries to you .gitignore file
```
siteConfig.py
